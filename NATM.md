# Two Trimester focus planning

## Capturing the data:

- While demoing, we payed close attention to the questions that the people were asking us and the things they were struggling with and as well as the things that they enjoyed as a result, we were able to compose the list below:

## Feedback from people:

- Some problems that occurred was that maybe some people don't know a person or who to draft so maybe a recommendations feature would eb helpful.
- Maybe also have the player details also showup on the drafting as well.
- The math behind how the teams are made was a little bit unclear so maybe trying to better explain or demo how the math was done for overall team score.

## Implementation into future:

- The idea of a recommendation feature seems pretty interesting and might be something that we would considering adding.
- The math explanation would also be interesting.
- The player stats on the drafting page as well would be interesting or make the player search draft for a team through there would also be a good feature.

## Reflection on glows/grows from your demo/presentations:

We think that our demonstration was definitely more captivating than any of the other projects we have been a part of in CS. Our demonstration was incredibly interactive, and we saw that the people who talked to us and tried out our basketball draft were genuinely pretty excited to see how the predictions turned out, and they were happy to win or lose. They were very interested to also understand how our simulation worked, and it was definitely good that all of our team members have a good understanding of how our project works inside and out, and were therefore all able to explain it to outsiders in an understandable manner. Something that we could work on for next time in terms of the demonstration is to make sure that everyone coming to our table can get the same experience - we noticed that sometimes when people would come over, we would show them solely the draft, and sometimes, if people were sticking around a bit longer at our table, we would show them both the drafting page and the individual statistics page. It would be better if everyone got the same exposure to our project, and this is something we can emphasize doing for next trimester's Night at the Museum.

## Something you saw in CompSci that impressive:

One project which we saw that had a lot of potential was in the CSSE section. They created a Super Mario game but with multiplayer capabilities. The game was interactive, had easy controls, and was visually appealing. Furthermore, there was a leaderboard where you could play and compare your score to your friends, which was pretty cool. It seemed professional and was impressive.
